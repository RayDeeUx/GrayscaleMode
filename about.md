# GrayscaleMode
By [RayDeeUx](user:7244751) and [Zilko](user:10300913).

Ever tried enabling Grayscale Mode on your device's accessibility settings so you could beat Backbeat Revenge, but got lost in the device settings and accidentally updated your operating system instead?

No? Just me? Darn...

Now you can have Grayscale Mode inside levels you find irritating to your eyes without affecting other in-game menus!

## Keybinds:
- Shift + X to toggle Grayscale Mode.
- Shift + Z to decrease Grayscale Mode's intensity.
- Shift + C to increase Grayscale Mode's intensity.

## Notes:
* Also comes with [Options API](mod:ninxout.options_api) integration so you can adjust Grayscale Mode's settings in real time (and without fumbling as often)!
* Also try [Dim Level](mod:sawblade.dim_mode)!

## Special Thanks
* [Zilko](user:10300913), for the shader code!
* [Prevter](user:7696536), who attempted this mod idea, but moved on to more worthwhile projects.
