# GrayscaleMode
Ever tried enabling Grayscale Mode on your device's accessibility settings so you could beat Backbeat Revenge, but got lost in the device settings and accidentally updated your operating system instead?

No? Just me? Darn...

Now you can have Grayscale Mode inside levels you find irritating to your eyes without affecting other in-game menus!
